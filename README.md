The pixelstick is an ADRESSABLE RGB LED STRIP controlled by an Arduino that can display all sorts of animations to make awesome [lightpaintings](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_painting) photographs. 

The Arduino circuit contains an SD Card module where I can upload the images I want to display.
